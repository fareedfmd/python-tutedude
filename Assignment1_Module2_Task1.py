# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

# take two numbers from the user

a = int(input("Enter the first number:"))
b = int(input("Enter the second number:"))

# To get a new line gap
print('\n')

# Addition operation
add = a + b
print("Addition:", add)

#Subtraction operation
sub = a - b
print("Subtraction:", sub)

# Multiplication operation
mul = a * b
print("Multiplication:", mul)

# Division operation
div = a / b
print("Division:", div)
